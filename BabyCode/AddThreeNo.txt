; THIS PROGRAM SHOULD DO ADD THREE NUMBERS TOGETHER
; The program starts at address 1, so we need to pad out address 0 
	VAR 0       ; Declare 32-bit variable to fill space
START: 	LDN NUM03   ; Copy variable to accumulator (negated)
	SUB NUM04   ; Subtract variable from accumulator to get sum (negated)
	SUB NUM05   ; Subtract variable from accumulator to get sum (negated)
	STO MYSUM1  ; Store accumulator to variable - saves answer
; The next two instructions negate the stored answer
	LDN MYSUM1   ; Copy variable to accumulator (negated)
        STO MYSUM1   ; Store accumulator to variable
END:	STP	    ; Stop processor
; Variable declarations follow
NUM03:   VAR 1025    ; Declare 32-bit variable, Showing off we can use different variable names
NUM04:   VAR 621     ; Declare 32-bit variable
NUM05: 	 VAR 784     ; Declare 32-bit variable
MYSUM1: VAR 0 ; Declare 32-bit variable
